Field Notes - Lichen very common on tree branches. Forms an irregular shaped thallus with a very low profile. Strong yellow-orange colour with the apothecia colouring somewhat darker. Tendency for the apothecia to congregate more towards the centre of the thallus, although that is hard to see in these specimens as the underlying bark has been removed in some spots, breaking up the pattern. Covering in some parts of the affected tree branches can be in excess of 80%, although the lichen is rarely, if ever, seen on the underside of tree branches, presumably due to lack of direct sunlight.
